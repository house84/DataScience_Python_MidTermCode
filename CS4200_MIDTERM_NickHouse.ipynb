    "Write a Python script to generate a list containing all permutations of a given number (from two up to eight or so, depending on your computer's capability, before your program crashes) of digits. Assume the input is provided as a list. Each permutation is to be represented as a list, and the final solution is to be printed as a list of (sub)lists (the order of the sub-lists does not matter), along with a count of the permutations. E.g.,\n",

    "Your program should be able to handle input lists of any length up to a certain (modest) limit. If your hardware platform cannot handle all the permutations beyond, say, 8 items, you will not be penalized (just submit the Jupyter notebook and the corresponding html). Show a few input-output cases, including the maximum size you can achieve. Do not use any ready-made function that produces permutations. Do not use hard coding (e.g., for [1, 2, 3, 4, 0], do not print all the 120 permutations by hand). As usual, this problem can be solved in many ways. You"
